# MSP430Examples
Examples of code to run on MSP430FR2355 LaunchPad boards.

## 1.) blinkingLED.c
This code is created to be used on a LaunchPad board but can be easily modified to work on other hardware. This is a simple start to micro-contoller programming. It will flash LED1 at a rate of 2Hz (or half a second intervals).

## 2.) buttonsLED.c
Very similar to the first bit of code as in we are flashing LEDs however, with this example we are changing the frequency at which they flash by using the two buttons. This includes the use of globals and interrupts to make this happen.
